        <p>War and Peace has a great many themes,but that might be its central one:We are all people,written the history that later generations will read about,even if we don't relize it.Every action we take makes some small marks upon it,even if that mark is eventually(inevitably) erased.Nothing is certain,until it is A timeless message of love amid chaos. Humanity's struggle for meaning and connection has always been at the core of our existence. That's the main tenet of War and Peace, which Leo Tolstoy masterfully illustrates by weaving together the lives of characters from vastly different backgrounds.</p>
