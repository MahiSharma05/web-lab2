    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots and cabbage</li>
        <li>soya sauce</li>
        <li>vinegar</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups meida </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make momos</h3><ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add warm water and knead to form a soft dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add the ginger-garlic paste and saut√© for a minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onions and cook until translucent. Then add the cabbage and carrots. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the soy sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes until the vegetables are tender. Remove from heat and let the filling cool.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a thin circle on a floured surface.</li>
                    <li>Spoon a small amount of filling into the center of each dough circle. Fold the edges over to seal the momo, pinching and pleating to ensure it is tightly closed.</li>
                    <li>Steam the momos in a steamer for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.</li> </ol>
